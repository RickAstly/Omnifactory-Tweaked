# Omnifactory Tweaked

This is a fork of the Omnifactory modpack created and maintained by BalaM314. It is currently the only actively maintained fork of Omnifactory(except ste). This fork slightly prioritizes ease of automation over balance.

The following major things were changed:
* Added several (Advanced Rocketry) planets. These planets also have a few exclusive ores, for more details see [GuideToThePlanets.md](guides/GuideToThePlanets.md).
* Add back gas mining, which allows Chlorine to be automated (yay!)
* Added Quark(and autoreglib)
* Make Certus Quartz and Garnet anything automateable, through Vitrified Sand
* Added dogecoin
* Made the pack never give you up
* Edited the pack to never let you down
* Forced the pack not to run around and desert you

For the rest of the changes, see [Tweaks.md](guides/Tweaks.md)

This fork *may* also get bug fixes more frequently than main Omnifactory.

Roadmap:
* [ ] Add more elements
* [ ] Add more fun catalyzed recipes
* [ ] Add more fun chemistry
* [ ] Try to make microminers more useful, especially t1mm post tank


Original Description:
