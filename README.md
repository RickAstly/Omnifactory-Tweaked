# Omnifactory Tweaked

This is a fork of the Omnifactory modpack created and maintained by BalaM314. It is currently the only actively maintained fork of Omnifactory(except ste). This fork slightly prioritizes ease of automation over balance.
The following major things were changed:
* Added several (Advanced Rocketry) planets. These planets also have a few exclusive ores, for more details see [GuideToThePlanets.md](guides/GuideToThePlanets.md).
* Add back gas mining, which allows Chlorine to be automated (yay!)
* Added Quark(and autoreglib)
* Make Certus Quartz and Garnet anything automateable, through Vitrified Sand
* Added dogecoin
For the rest of the changes, see [Tweaks.md](guides/Tweaks.md)
This fork *may* also get bug fixes more frequently than main Omnifactory.



Original Description:

Omnifactory is a quest-driven, expert-style tech modpack focused on automating large-scale factories. It features a custom take on GregTechCE-centered progression that we hope everyone will enjoy.
